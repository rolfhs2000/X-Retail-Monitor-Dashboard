# X-Retail-Monitor-Dashboard
0. Dashboard is focusing on solving the following 3 problems:
[1] Support stakeholders to monitor operational indicators with the goal of boosting revenue, identifying abnormalities, and discovering patterns.
[2] Identify VIP customer groups, almost churn customer group to have appropriate care strategies for each customer group.
[3] Analyze high return rates from many perspectives: time, product, location, shipping mode,... with a focus on product groups.

1. Dataset
This dataset is the sales data of a retail business with full: order, order details as usual.

2. Live Dashboard
You can view the dashboard directly on PBI Service here: [https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZjRkMjQxYTQtZWE1ZS00OTlkLTkwZWMtMzUzOTY1ZDllYjFkIiwidCI6IjJmODVkYzc0LWI2YjQtNDU4NC1iZWVlLWNjZGE3MTQ0NDk3MCIsImMiOjZ9]

3. Dashboard description
Dashboard includes 4 pages:
- Page 1 - Sales Overview: This page is used to monitor operational indicators.
- Page 2 - Customers: This page segments customers according to the RFM method => Support stakeholders to identify VIP customer files for special care; identify customer files about to leave to develop retention strategies.
- Page 3 - Return Rate: This page shows return rate index. In particular, automatically identify product groups with high return rates.
- Page 4 - Sales Details: This page shows order details for lookup purposes.

4. Insight & Recommendation
Due to personal schedules, I will temporarily focus on showing dashboard delevop skills in this section.
If you are interested in the analysis, I have an analysis of "Boost Sales For Pizza Restaurant" using Python, presented in Power Point here: [https://github.com/rolfhs2000/Revenue-structure-analytic-for-Pizza-Restaurant/blob/main/data/processed/Restaurant%20Analytics.pdf]
